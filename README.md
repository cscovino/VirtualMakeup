# VirtualMakeup

A Computer Vision project using only Opencv and Dlib with Python.

## Features

For this project I decided to implement two popular features that people use often:

- [Apply Lipstick](https://github.com/cscovino/VirtualMakeup/blob/master/VirtualMakeup_ApplyLipstick.ipynb)
- [Apply Eyes Color (Lens)](https://github.com/cscovino/VirtualMakeup/blob/master/VirtualMakeup_EyesColor.ipynb)

You can see the explanation to do it in the jupyter notebooks of each one.
