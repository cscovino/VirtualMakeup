# VirtualMakeup

A Computer Vision project using only Opencv and Dlib with Python.

## Features

For this project I decided to implement two popular features that people use often:

- Apply Lipstick
- Apply Eyes Color (Lens)

You can see the explanation to do it in the jupyter notebooks of each one.
